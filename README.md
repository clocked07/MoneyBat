<h2> Quick guide </h2>

Setup.bat -----> Run this first to get MoneyBat up and running!

MoneyBat.bat ----> The main script, use it to log your spendings.

Update.bat ----> Add money to your budget.

Reset.bat ---> Something went wrong? Start from scratch.

MoneyBat.log ----> A log of all your spendings

budget.MoneyBat ----> Mostly so that MoneyBat can keep track of your budget. Your remaining budget is logged in MoneyBat.log anyway.

<h2> Notes </h2>

- MoneyBat.log & budget.MoneyBat only appear after you've run Setup & MoneyBat atleast once.
- To update MoneyBat's code, run 'git pull'. Your budget and logs will NOT be reset and you needn't run Setup.bat again.
