&emsp; <h3> Other </h3>

&emsp;&emsp;.gitignore ---> Files to be ignored while pushing git updates.. Used to prevent upload of confidential files (By Mate0xz)

&emsp;&emsp;.git ---> Present if you cloned the repository. Used by git to manage commits, push and pull code, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;Wallet ----> Mostly so that MoneyBat can keep track of your budget. Your remaining budget is logged in Spent.log anyway. This stores your budget.

<h2> Notes </h2>

- To update MoneyBat's code, run 'git pull'. Your budget and logs will NOT be reset and you needn't run Setup.bat again. If you don't have git you can download the zip file and transfer logs/ & Wallet to the new folder.
